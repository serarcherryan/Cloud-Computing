# Cloud-Computing

## Instructions
This project contains the source code of the Hadoop assignment. You may not run the code directly until you start Hadoop and HDFS on your own machine. Besides, you should also put the files and directories into the right place.

To run this project, you should download the [Hadoop-3.3.2](https://dlcdn.apache.org/hadoop/core/hadoop-3.3.2/).

Install and start your Hadoop: [Reference](https://www.michael-noll.com/tutorials/running-hadoop-on-ubuntu-linux-single-node-cluster/)

Then put *run-all.sh* and */scripts* directory into */hadoop*.

Put your input data([mr.data](http://soudeh.net/teaching/cloud/files/mr.data)) into */tmp/mr.data*.

Then you can successfully run the *run-all.sh*.
